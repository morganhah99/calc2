		<h1 style="text-align:center">Vi Tutorial</h1>
		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>Vi is a visal text editor included by default on Unix operating systems.<br>
		It is a character-based screen editor without a GUI. One of Vi's major draws<br>
		is its ubiquity and accessibility. You don't need a desktop enviornment to use it,<br>
		and it is typically already installed on your system.<br>
		Vi gives users a robust editing experience without ever having to leave the keyboard's<br>
		home row. With a dedicated command mode, Vi utilizes the full keyboard for tasks<br>
		like navigating a file, manipulating text, searching, and replacing phrases
		</p>
		<h3>How to open Vi editor</h3>
		<p>You can open up Vi with the vi command. Generally, if your system uses vim, this command still links<br>
		to it, but you can also use the vim command in that case. You could alternatively, open Vi with a file<br>
		using the vi [example-file.txt], replace example-file with the path to the desired file
		</p>
		<h3>Vi modes</h3>
		<p>Vi has two distinct modes, getting familiar with them helps you get the most out of Vi</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Normal mode: This mode is also known as "command mode" and is the mode where you enter<br>
			most of your Vi commands. Key pressed in normal mode are evaluated as commands and not as text<br>
			entered on the file you are editing.</li>
			<li>Insert mode: This mode is your main place for entering text. Here, your key presses tend to<br>
			operate how you would expect in a text editor. You can enter this mode by pressing the i key<br>
			while you are in normal mode. Alternatively, you can press the o key to insert a new line<br>
			and immediately enter Insert mode.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Common Vi commands in normal mode</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Opens a file in the current user's home directory</li>
			<pre class="command">:e ~/example-file</pre>
			<li>Writes changes to a file, if you want to specify the file to save to,
				add the path after the command</li>
			<pre class="command">:w ~/example-file</pre>
		</ul>
		<div id="navigation">
		<h3>Navigation</h3>
		<p>You can navigate text in Vi using the arrow keys, whether in normal or insert mode. However, in<br>
		normal mode, you can also use the keys in the list below. Some of these keys help keep you from<br>
		laving the home row for the arrow keys, but most add handy and efficient navigation shortcuts</p>
		<ul>
			<li>j</li>
			<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor down a line</pre>
			<li>k</li>
			<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor up a line</pre>
			<li>h</li>
			<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor to the left one character position</pre>
			<li>l</li>
			<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor to the right one character position</pre>
		</ul>
		<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>yy</li>
			<pre class="command">Copies the current line</pre>
			<li>p</li>
			<pre class="command">Pastes the copied text after the Cursor</pre>
		</ul>
		<h3>Copy and Paste</h3>
		
 		<ul>
                        <li>yy</li>
                        <pre class="command">Copies the current line</pre>
                        <li>p</li>
                        <pre class="command">Pastes the copied text after the Cursor</pre>
                </ul>
		<h3>String Search</h3>
		<p>When you start these commands, the command just typed will be shown on the last line of the screen, where you type the particular string to look for</p>
		<ul>
			<li>/</li>
			<pre class="command">Searches forwards (downwards) in the file</pre>
			<li>?</li>
			<pre class="command">Searches backwards (upwards) in the file</pre>
		<h3>How to exit Vi</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>:q</li>
			<pre class="command">Quit</pre>
			<li>:q!</li>
			<pre class="command">Quit without saving</pre>
			<li>:w</li>
			<pre class="command">Save contents of the file</pre>
			<li>:wq</li>
			<pre class="command">Quits and saves contents</pre>
